# Trading Interface Fix Summary

## Issue
The trading interface was showing "400 Bad Request" errors when attempting to execute trades, despite the backend actually returning 200 OK responses.

## Root Cause
1. **Type Mismatch**: The frontend was sending numeric values for `solAmount` and `tokenAmount`, but the backend expected strings
2. **Missing Slippage**: The slippage parameter wasn't being included in the trade payload
3. **Response Handling**: The frontend wasn't properly handling the backend's response structure which wraps data in `{ success: true, data: {...} }`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Service (`src/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
- Updated `executeTrade` method to convert numeric amounts to strings
- Added slippage parameter to the payload
- Extended response type to include all trade result fields (inputAmount, outputAmount, pricePerToken, fees, etc.)

### 2. Trading Interface Component (`src/frontend/src/components/TradingInterface.tsx`)
- Improved success message to show actual trade amounts
- Added proper error checking for response.error
- Enhanced user feedback with formatted trade details

## Backend Response Structure
The backend returns trades with this structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "signature": "dev_tx_...",
    "inputAmount": 0.5,
    "outputAmount": 17299690.40,
    "pricePerToken": 2.9e-8,
    "fees": {
      "platform": 0.0025,
      "creator": 0.0025,
      "total": 0.005
    },
    "newPrice": 2.9e-8,
    "newSupply": 5647058.82,
    "graduationProgress": 0.71,
    "priceImpact": 3.35
  }
}
```

## Verification
- Buy trades: ✅ Working correctly
- Sell trades: ✅ Working correctly
- WebSocket updates: ✅ Broadcasting trade events
- Price impact calculations: ✅ Accurate
- Fee calculations: ✅ Correct (1% total - 0.5% platform, 0.5% creator)

## Test Results
1. **Buy Test**: 0.5 SOL → 17,299,690.40 tokens (3.35% price impact)
2. **Sell Test**: 1,000,000 tokens → 0.0288 SOL (-0.19% price impact)

The trading interface is now fully functional and properly handling all trade operations.
